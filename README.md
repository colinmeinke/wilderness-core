# Wilderness core

This is the SVG animation engine (soon) to be behind
[Wilderness](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness).

Unless you are a library author you most likely want to head to
one of the following implementations of Wilderness core.

- [Wilderness](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness) (standalone DOM). *A few days away from launch*
- [Wilderness React](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness-react) (for use with React). *Coming soon*

Full documentation will appear shortly at
[wilderness.now.sh](https://wilderness.now.sh).
