Unless you are a library author you most likely want to head to
one of the following implementations of Wilderness core:

- [Wilderness](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness) (standalone DOM). *A few days away from launch.*
- [Wilderness React](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness-react) (for use with React). *Coming soon.*

Full documentation and examples will appear shortly at
[wilderness.now.sh](https://wilderness.now.sh).
